            We are scrupulous about following the laws of the Pakistan to ensure the
            highest food safety and Halal standards. Food safety regulations differ
            from country to country and range from standards set by local government 
            authorities to international regulatory bodies such as the 
            World Health Organization. Generally, McDonald's sets its own company
            standards at or above the very highest of international standards

          Important Note: <br>
At McDonald's, we take great care to serve quality, great-tasting menu items to our customers each and every time they visit our restaurants.
 We understand that each of our customers has individual needs and considerations when choosing a place to eat or drink outside their home, especially those customers with food allergies. 
 As part of our commitment to you, we provide the most current ingredient information available from our food suppliers for the eight most common allergens, so that our guests with food allergies can make informed food selections.
  However, we also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation areas, equipment and utensils, and the possibility exists
   for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including allergens.
   We encourage our customers with food allergies or special dietary needs to visit Contact Us for ingredient information, and to consult their doctor for questions regarding their diet. 
   Due to the individualized nature of food allergies and food sensitivities, customers' physicians may be best positioned to make recommendations for customers with food allergies and special dietary needs.
 If you have questions about our food, please reach out to us directly at <a href="#">Contact Us</a>.

          The nutrition information on this website is derived from testing conducted in 
          accredited laboratories, published resources, or from information provided from
           McDonald's suppliers. The nutrition information is based on standard product 
           formulations and serving sizes. Calories for fountain beverages are based on standard
            fill levels plus ice. If you use the self-service fountain inside the restaurant for
            your drink order, see the sign posted at the beverage fountain for beverage calories
            without ice. Variation in serving sizes, preparation techniques, product testing 
            and sources of supply, as well as regional and seasonal differences may affect the
            nutrition values for each product. In addition, product formulations change
            periodically. You should expect some variation in the nutrient content of the
            products purchased in our restaurants. Beverage sizes may vary in your market.
            Our fried menu items are cooked in a vegetable oil blend with citric acid added
            as a processing aid and dimethylpolysiloxane to reduce oil splatter when cooking.
           This information is correct as of May 2020, unless stated otherwise.
